## Lyrics

```
so long
so long
so long
yeah

so long 
so long
so long 
yeah

so long 
so long
so long 
yeah
ya
had a better chance when i was here
- i thought i made it clear 
to all the hateeeers (bumpin' me)
winding down you thought but i just disappeared
aye

good stuff in the clots, feeling phased
i thought, made a pact with my blood and thoughts
veins tied into knots, constricted
flows must break through the fog
before the night is (over)
aye

in a flash of light and/then suddenly everything became so clear
in my mind traces of fear turned previous passions into naught

turn around you fool
turn around


```
